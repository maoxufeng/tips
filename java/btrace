Warning
  v1.2 has different API comparing to priors

Weird
  It seems I always got message below for the 2nd time attaching a Java process,
  but the much more weird thing is, it works for the 3rd, 4th times.
  Do not get frustrated when you run into the message, just keep trying.
    ----
    java.lang.LinkageError: loader (instance of  <bootloader>): attempted  duplicate class definition for name:
